# fibonacci.py
Test Fibonacci algorithms

Just a script with two functions: fibonacci(n) which performs a recursive fibonacci calculation
and fast_fibonacci(n) which is a faster implementation. Main program loop asks for n input
and which algorithm to use. Outputs n-th position in fibonacci sequence.
